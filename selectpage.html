        </div>
        <p>Cars bring me sheer joy,
           You can know or not know how a car runs and still enjoy riding in a car,
           I am emotional about engines, if you hurt my car, you hurt my heart,
           Money may not buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in a Jaguar than on a bus.</p>

            </div>
        <p>In this life, we're all sitting next to each other,
            When you ride a bus, you learn more about people,
            It can be like a scene from a movie when you're riding a bus,
            You want someone who would endure the bus with you.

        </div>
        <p>Trains are wonderful.... To travel by train is to see nature and human beings, towns and churches, and rivers, in fact, to see life,Many times the wrong train took me to the right place,Trains are beautiful.
